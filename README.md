<h2>360 Total Security 10</h2>
<p>Security products often feature a comprehensive array of tools to keep your computer free from malware and ensure smooth, error-free performance. 360 Total Security is one such application, offering an antivirus scanner, cleanup utility, and startup booster, all integrated into an intuitive graphical user interface.

Antivirus Protection Powered by Three Distinct Engines
When you launch the application for the first time, it thoroughly analyzes your PC's status to identify areas that may need improvement. You can then initiate an antivirus scan, choosing between full, quick, or custom options. Once the scan is complete, 360 Total Security provides a detailed report of all detected threats, allowing you to specify the actions to take. If you are confident that a flagged file is safe, you can mark it as trustworthy, and the application will no longer alert you about it in the future. Otherwise, any detected files can be moved to quarantine.
